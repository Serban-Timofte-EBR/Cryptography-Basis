# Symmetric Cryptography

## 1. Introduction: Why Symmetric Encryption Exists

Imagine two friends, **Alice** and **Bob**, living in the 1940s during World War II.  
They need to exchange secret messages over radio, but there’s a problem — anyone can listen.  
How can they communicate privately if the enemy (Eve) might intercept their transmission?

Alice and Bob agree to use a **shared secret key** — something they both know in advance, but no one else does.

When Alice sends a message `M`:
```
E(M, K) → Ciphertext C
```
Bob can decrypt it using the **same key** `K`:
```
D(C, K) → Message M
```
This is **symmetric encryption** — both encryption and decryption use **the same key**.

---

## 2. The Nature of Symmetric Systems

### 2.1. Definition
A symmetric cryptographic system (also known as **private-key** or **single-key**) is one where:
- The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- Both sender and receiver must **share and protect** that key.

### 2.2. Requirements
To work securely, symmetric encryption needs:
1. A **secret key** known only by the communicating parties.  
2. A **strong encryption algorithm** that transforms plaintext unpredictably.  
3. A **secure key distribution mechanism** (often the hardest part).

Before 1970, **all cryptography was symmetric**. Public-key cryptography didn’t exist yet.

## 3. Transposition Ciphers — Mixing Without Changing

Imagine you’re baking a cake. You have all the ingredients (letters of your message), but instead of changing what they are, you just **change the order** in which they’re added. That’s a **transposition cipher**.

A transposition cipher **rearranges characters** of the plaintext but does not change the characters themselves.

Example:

```
Plaintext:  HELLO
Key:        Permutation [3, 1, 4, 5, 2]
Ciphertext: LHOEL
```

The “alphabet soup” is the same, but the letters are scrambled.

---

### 3.1. How It Works
- The message is divided into **blocks** of equal length.  
- Each block is **reordered** according to a permutation key.

Formally, for key K = (d, f):  
- `d` defines the block size.  
- `f` defines the permutation rule.

The alphabet remains unchanged — only their positions move.

---

### 3.2. Real-World Analogy

Think of a **library shelf** with 10 books. A transposition cipher is like a librarian who secretly rearranges the books according to a private pattern only they know.  
Anyone looking at the shelf sees the same books but in a confusing order.

---

### 3.3. Mono-Phase and Multi-Phase

- **Mono-phase**: The permutation happens once per block.  
- **Multi-phase**: The message is repeatedly permuted using different rules, creating more complexity.

---

## 4. Monographic Transposition Cipher — Encrypting Character by Character

Let’s follow a small story:

Alice wants to encrypt “CALCULATOR” using a 4-column grid. She writes:

```
C A L C
U L A T
O R _ _
```

Now she reads vertically instead of horizontally:

```
C U O A L R L A C T
```
Result: **CUOALRL ACT** → Ciphertext.

In the slide example, “CALCULATOR” became “CLAALTCOUR” — the idea is the same: shuffle by a defined pattern.

---

### 4.1. The Key Intuition

The key controls **how** the characters move — not what they become.  
The encryption power lies in the **permutation order**, not the symbol change.

This idea, though simple, still appears in modern ciphers (like **DES** and **AES**) as part of the **diffusion process**.

---

## 5. Substitution Ciphers — Changing What You See

If transposition is like rearranging letters, **substitution** is like **repainting** them.

Each letter or group of letters is replaced by another symbol according to a fixed rule.

Example:
```
A → D
B → E
C → F
...
```
This is the **Caesar cipher**, one of the oldest encryption techniques in history.

```
HELLO → KHOOR (each letter +3 in the alphabet)
```

---

### 5.1. Real-World Story

Think of a child’s secret club where they replace every letter with a different one.  
Anyone who finds their message can read it **only** if they know the shifting rule.

That rule is the **key** — if someone discovers it, the entire system collapses.

---

### 5.2. Weakness

Substitution ciphers are easy to break using **frequency analysis**.  
For example, in English, the letter ‘E’ appears most frequently, so attackers can guess substitutions based on letter patterns.

This is why modern systems **combine substitution and transposition**, creating **product ciphers**.

---

## 6. One-Time Pad (OTP) — The Perfect Cipher

The **One-Time Pad** is the only cipher mathematically proven to be **unbreakable**.

### 6.1. How It Works
- Generate a **random key** as long as the message.  
- XOR each bit of the plaintext with the corresponding bit of the key.  
- Destroy the key after one use.

Example (in binary):

```
Message: 10101010
Key:     01100101
Cipher:  11001111
```

### 6.2. Why It’s Perfect

If the key is **truly random**, used only once, and kept secret — no statistical pattern can be exploited.  
Claude Shannon proved this in 1949 as **perfect secrecy**.

---

### 6.3. Real-World Limitations

In practice, OTPs are hard to use because:
- Keys must be as long as the messages.
- Both parties must exchange them securely.
- Keys can’t be reused — ever.

Used primarily by spies and military agencies (e.g., the **Soviet KGB** in the Cold War).

---

## 7. Rotor Machines — The Mechanical Age of Encryption

Before computers, cryptography was mechanical.

### 7.1. The Birth of the Rotor Machine

In the early 20th century, engineers developed devices that used **rotating disks** to automate substitution ciphers.

Each key press on the keyboard would:
1. Electrically encode a letter through multiple wired rotors.
2. After encoding, rotors rotated — changing the mapping for the next letter.

This created a **polyalphabetic substitution** — a cipher that changed dynamically.

---

## 8. The Enigma Machine — Germany’s Secret Weapon

Perhaps the most famous rotor machine, **Enigma** was used by Nazi Germany during WWII.

### 8.1. How Enigma Worked

- It used **three or more rotors**, each wired with a unique substitution pattern.  
- After every keypress, rotors advanced like a mechanical odometer.  
- The machine produced a **different encryption** for the same letter each time.

Example: typing `AAAAA` might produce `XGMPZ`.

### 8.2. The Problem Enigma Solved — and Created

Enigma provided strong encryption but had an operational flaw:  
German operators **reused message keys**, allowing Allied cryptanalysts (like Alan Turing) to exploit patterns.

The **Bletchley Park team** used early computers (the Bombe) to break Enigma, changing the course of history.

---

## 9. Lorenz Cipher — The Secret Teleprinter Encryption

While Enigma secured tactical messages, Lorenz encrypted **strategic high-level communications** between Nazi leaders.

Lorenz used **12 rotors** and operated on **binary teleprinter signals**.  
It produced a stream cipher output — effectively a mechanical version of a **One-Time Pad**.

---

## 10. Product Ciphers — Combining the Best of Both Worlds

Product ciphers combine **substitution (confusion)** and **transposition (diffusion)** to create layered security.

Example of conceptual structure:

```
Plaintext → Substitution → Transposition → Substitution → Ciphertext
```

This layering increases resistance to both frequency and positional attacks.

Modern ciphers like **DES** and **AES** are **product ciphers**.

---

## 11. Confusion and Diffusion — The Core Ideas

These terms were introduced by Claude Shannon in 1949.

| Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Confusion** | Makes the relationship between key and ciphertext as complex as possible. | Substitution |
| **Diffusion** | Spreads influence of one plaintext symbol over many ciphertext symbols. | Transposition |

Example: In AES, confusion comes from S-boxes, and diffusion comes from matrix mixing.

Together, they make patterns invisible and reverse-engineering infeasible.

---

## 12. Feistel Network — The Blueprint of Modern Block Ciphers

Developed by **Horst Feistel** at IBM in the 1970s, this structure powers most block ciphers such as **DES**, **Blowfish**, and **Twofish**.  
It is one of the most influential designs in the history of cryptography because it allows for **reversible encryption** even when the internal function is *not invertible*.

---

### 12.1. The Core Problem It Solves

Encryption must do two things:

1. Be **reversible**, so we can decrypt the message.
2. Be **nonlinear and complex**, so attackers can’t detect patterns.

However, if we apply an arbitrary complex function to data, it often becomes **impossible to reverse**.

Feistel’s brilliant insight:
> “Let’s design an encryption structure that is *always reversible* — even if the inner function is not.”

This structure guarantees decryptability **without** needing to compute the inverse of the encryption function.

---

### 12.2. The Core Principle — Two Halves Dancing

Take a plaintext block of data, for example 64 bits, and **split it into two halves**:

- Left half → `L0`
- Right half → `R0`

Encryption proceeds in multiple **rounds**, and in each round, the two halves “dance” together:

- One half is transformed by a function `F()`.
- The other half is mixed with that output.
- Then the halves swap positions.

---

### 12.3. One Round of Feistel — Step-by-Step

For each round `i`, we do the following:

```
L_i+1 = R_i
R_i+1 = L_i XOR F(R_i, K_i)
```

Explanation:

- **`F(R_i, K_i)`**: The round function — a complex, nonlinear transformation using the round key `K_i`.  
  It may involve substitutions, permutations, and arithmetic operations.

- **`L_i XOR F(R_i, K_i)`**: Combines the function’s output with the left half using XOR, ensuring reversibility.

- Then the halves **swap roles** — what was right becomes left, and vice versa.

This process repeats for several rounds (e.g., 16 in DES).

---

### 12.4. Why It’s Reversible

Even though `F()` can be arbitrary and not invertible, the Feistel design ensures that **decryption** is possible using the same steps, only with **keys in reverse order**.

During decryption:

### 12.5. Visualization

```
Plaintext:   L0 | R0
Round 1 →   L1 = R0
             R1 = L0 XOR F(R0, K1)
Round 2 →   L2 = R1
             R2 = L1 XOR F(R1, K2)
...
Ciphertext: Ln | Rn
```


## 13. Feistel Cipher Design Elements

When designing or evaluating a Feistel cipher, engineers consider:

- **Block size:** Larger blocks resist statistical attacks.  
- **Key size:** Determines brute-force resistance.  
- **Number of rounds:** More rounds = higher security.  
- **Subkey generation algorithm:** Should prevent related-key attacks.  
- **Round function:** Provides confusion and diffusion.  
- **Ease of implementation:** Must be efficient for hardware/software.  
- **Ease of analysis:** Should allow formal proof of security bounds.

## 14. Complex Ciphers — The Evolution of Symmetric Encryption

### 14.1. 64-bit Era (Pre-1997)
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** — Feistel network, 16 rounds, 56-bit key.  
- **IDEA** — used in PGP, mixing modular addition and XOR.  
- **FEAL**, **LOKI**, **RC2**, **Lucifer** — regional or experimental designs.

### 14.2. 128-bit Era (Post-1997)
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** — Rijndael algorithm; replaced DES.  
- **Twofish**, **Serpent**, **RC6**, **MARS**, **Blowfish** — competitors in AES contest.

AES won due to its balance of **security, speed, and simplicity**.

---

## 15. Why Symmetric Encryption Still Matters

Even in the age of public-key cryptography, symmetric encryption remains **the backbone** of data security.

Why?
- It’s **faster** — ideal for large data (files, disks, VPNs).  
- It’s **energy-efficient** — critical for embedded systems and IoT.  
- It’s **used inside** most asymmetric systems (TLS, PGP, etc.) after key exchange.

---

## 16. Summary Story

Let’s summarize through Alice and Bob once more:

1. Alice writes a message to Bob.  
2. They both share a **secret key** decided earlier.  
3. Alice encrypts it with a **symmetric algorithm**.  
4. Bob decrypts using the **same key**.  
5. Eve, the eavesdropper, sees only gibberish.

This is the **essence of symmetric cryptography** — two minds united by one shared secret.

---

## Final Takeaway

> “Symmetric cryptography is about trust.  
> Public-key cryptography is about mathematics.  
> Security is about using both wisely.”
