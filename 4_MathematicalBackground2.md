# Hash Functions

## Algorithm Complexity

- Algorithm complexity is measured by the relationship between input length and processing time

### P vs NP Problem

- **P**: Problems that can be solved in polynomial time
- **NP**: Problems where solutions can be verified in polynomial time
- **Key Question**: If verifying a solution takes polynomial time, how much time is needed to find all possible solutions?

#### Shopping Bag Example

Imagine you're doing your shopping and putting all items in a bag. You tell me the total weight of your bag is 5 kg and ask me to recreate the exact same combination of items without looking inside the bag.

- **Verification (P)**: I can easily verify if my recreated bag weighs 5 kg by putting it on a scale - this takes polynomial time
- **Finding the solution (NP)**: However, finding the exact combination of items that gives 5 kg without seeing inside requires trying potentially exponential combinations of products

This illustrates the P vs NP gap: verifying a solution is easy, but finding it among all possibilities can be computationally expensive.

### Big Numbers in Cryptography

- **Definition**: Big numbers refer to integers with at least 100 digits (much larger than standard data types like `long long`)
- **Storage**: Numbers are managed using arrays or specialized data structures
- **Operations**: Arithmetic uses each digit multiplied by appropriate powers of 10 or base operations

#### Cryptographic Significance

- **RSA Keys**: Typical RSA keys use 2048-bit numbers (approximately 617 decimal digits)
- **Prime Numbers**: Cryptographic security relies on the difficulty of factoring products of large primes
- **Discrete Logarithm**: Many cryptosystems depend on the computational difficulty of solving discrete logarithm problems with large numbers

#### Implementation Challenges

- **Multiplication**: Standard algorithms become inefficient; specialized methods like Karatsuba or FFT-based multiplication are used
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Essential for cryptographic operations, requires efficient modular reduction algorithms
- **Prime Generation**: Testing primality of large numbers requires probabilistic algorithms like Miller-Rabin
- **Memory Management**: Large numbers require careful memory allocation and optimization

#### Performance Considerations

- **Time Complexity**: Operations on n-digit numbers typically require O(nÂ²) time for basic multiplication
- **Space Complexity**: Storage requirements grow linearly with number size
- **Optimization**: Libraries like GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) provide highly optimized implementations

#### Security Implications

- **Key Size**: Larger numbers provide stronger security but require more computational resources
- **Quantum Resistance**: Current large number cryptography may be vulnerable to quantum computers
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Implementation must protect against timing and power analysis attacks

### Randon Numbers

- Problem: How do we choose these random numbers? Is choosing in a class enough?
- There are tests to determine if some numbers are really random
  - Statistically random, uniform distribution, independent

#### Source: True Random Numbers Generator (TRNG)

- Uses **entropy** to make sure that is completely random

**What is TRNG?**
A True Random Number Generator relies on unpredictable physical phenomena to generate truly random numbers. Think of it like rolling a perfect dice - each outcome is genuinely unpredictable.

**Sources of Entropy (Randomness):**

- **Mouse movements and keyboard timings** - The exact microsecond you move your mouse is unpredictable
- **Atmospheric noise** - Radio static from space and weather
- **Hardware noise** - Electronic components naturally produce random electrical fluctuations
- **Radioactive decay** - The exact moment an atom decays is quantum-mechanically random

**Practical Examples:**

```java
// Example: Using SecureRandom in Java (hardware-based entropy)
import java.security.SecureRandom;

public class TrueRandomExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // SecureRandom uses the system's entropy pool
        SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
        
        // Generate 16 truly random bytes
        byte[] trueRandomBytes = new byte[16];
        secureRandom.nextBytes(trueRandomBytes);
        
        // Convert to hex for display
        StringBuilder hex = new StringBuilder();
        for (byte b : trueRandomBytes) {
            hex.append(String.format("%02x", b));
        }
        
        System.out.println("True random: " + hex.toString());
    }
}
```

**Real-world Usage:**

- **Generating master encryption keys** for banks and governments
- **Creating SSL certificates** for websites
- **Cryptocurrency wallet seed generation**
- **Gaming industry** for fair lottery systems

**Gotcha:** TRNGs are slow! They might only produce a few hundred random bits per second because they must wait for physical events.

#### Source: Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNG)

**What is PRNG?**
A Pseudo Random Number Generator uses mathematical algorithms to produce numbers that *appear* random but are actually deterministic. Think of it like a very complex recipe - if you know the recipe (algorithm) and starting ingredient (seed), you can reproduce the exact same "random" sequence.

**How it works:**

```java
// Simple example of Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
class SimplePRNG {
    private long current;
    
    public SimplePRNG(long seed) {
        this.current = seed;
    }
    
    public long nextRandom() {
        // Formula: (a * current + c) % m
        this.current = (1664525L * this.current + 1013904223L) % (1L << 32);
        return this.current;
    }
}

// Same seed = same sequence!
SimplePRNG prng1 = new SimplePRNG(12345);
SimplePRNG prng2 = new SimplePRNG(12345);

System.out.println("PRNG1: " + prng1.nextRandom());  // Same output
System.out.println("PRNG2: " + prng2.nextRandom());  // Same output
```

**Practical Examples:**

```java
import java.util.Random;

// Java's built-in PRNG
Random random = new Random(42);  // Setting the seed
System.out.println(random.nextInt(100) + 1);  // Always produces: 82
System.out.println(random.nextInt(100) + 1);  // Always produces: 15

// Reset with same seed
random = new Random(42);
System.out.println(random.nextInt(100) + 1);  // Again produces: 82
```

**Cloudflare's Random Beacon Example:**

```java
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.MessageDigest;

public class CloudflareRandomBeacon {
    private static final String CLOUDFLARE_BEACON_URL = "https://drand.cloudflare.com/public/latest";
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Fetch random beacon from Cloudflare's drand network
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
            .uri(URI.create(CLOUDFLARE_BEACON_URL))
            .build();
        
        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, 
            HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
        
        System.out.println("Cloudflare Random Beacon Response:");
        System.out.println(response.body());
        
        // Extract randomness value (this is publicly verifiable)
        // The beacon provides cryptographically secure randomness
        // that can be verified by anyone using threshold cryptography
        
        // Example: Use beacon randomness as seed for PRNG
        String randomnessHex = extractRandomnessFromJson(response.body());
        long seed = hashToLong(randomnessHex);
        
        Random seededRandom = new Random(seed);
        System.out.println("PRNG seeded with Cloudflare beacon: " + 
                          seededRandom.nextInt(1000));
    }
    
    private static String extractRandomnessFromJson(String json) {
        // Simple extraction - in production use proper JSON parser
        int start = json.indexOf("\"randomness\":\"") + 14;
        int end = json.indexOf("\"", start);
        return json.substring(start, end);
    }
    
    private static long hashToLong(String hex) throws Exception {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        byte[] hash = md.digest(hex.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        
        // Convert first 8 bytes to long
        long result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            result = (result << 8) + (hash[i] & 0xff);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Why Cloudflare's drand Beacon?**

- **Lava Lamp Entropy**: Cloudflare uses a wall of lava lamps as one of their entropy sources - the unpredictable bubbling patterns in the lamps provide true randomness that gets fed into their cryptographic systems
- **Publicly Verifiable**: Anyone can verify the randomness using cryptographic proofs
- **Unpredictable**: Generated using threshold cryptography across multiple servers
- **Timestamped**: Each beacon pulse is tied to a specific time (every 30 seconds)
- **Distributed Trust**: No single entity can control or predict the output

**Real-world Usage:**

- **Video game procedural generation** - Minecraft worlds use seeds
- **Simulations and modeling** - Weather prediction, traffic simulation
- **Testing and debugging** - Reproducible test cases
- **Monte Carlo methods** - Financial risk analysis

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | TRNG | PRNG |
|--------|------|------|
| **Speed** | Slow (100s-1000s bits/sec) | Very fast (millions/sec) |
| **Predictability** | Unpredictable | Predictable with seed |
| **Reproducibility** | Never repeats | Can reproduce sequences |
| **Security** | Cryptographically secure | Depends on algorithm |
| **Cost** | Expensive hardware | Software only |

**When to Use Which:**

**Use TRNG when:**

- Generating cryptographic keys
- Creating passwords for high-security systems
- Gambling/lottery applications
- Scientific research requiring true randomness

**Use PRNG when:**

- Game development (procedural generation)
- Simulations requiring reproducible results
- Testing (need same "random" data every time)
- General programming where security isn't critical

**Security Gotcha:**
Never use basic PRNGs (like `Random`) for security! Use cryptographically secure PRNGs:

```java
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.util.Base64;

// For security applications
SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();

// Generate secure token (16 bytes = 32 hex characters)
byte[] tokenBytes = new byte[16];
secureRandom.nextBytes(tokenBytes);
String secureToken = bytesToHex(tokenBytes);

// Generate secure password (32 bytes, URL-safe base64)
byte[] passwordBytes = new byte[32];
secureRandom.nextBytes(passwordBytes);
String securePassword = Base64.getUrlEncoder().withoutPadding().encodeToString(passwordBytes);

// Helper method to convert bytes to hex
private static String bytesToHex(byte[] bytes) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (byte b : bytes) {
        result.append(String.format("%02x", b));
    }
    return result.toString();
}
```

**Hybrid Approach:**
Many systems combine both:

1. Use TRNG to generate a truly random seed
2. Use that seed in a cryptographically secure PRNG for fast, secure random numbers

This gives you the security of TRNG with the speed of PRNG!

##### PRNG Good Examples

- Yarrow - Developed by Bruce Schneier, Yarrow is a cryptographic PRNG that uses multiple entropy sources and is designed for high security applications. It employs a combination of entropy pools and a reseeding mechanism to ensure unpredictability.

- ANSI X9.17 - This is a standard for generating cryptographic keys using a PRNG based on the DES encryption algorithm. It combines a seed value with a timestamp and encrypts it to produce pseudo-random output.

- Blum Blum Shub - A cryptographically secure PRNG based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. It generates random bits using modular arithmetic and is considered secure for cryptographic applications.

1. Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) - One of the simplest and oldest PRNG algorithms, LCG generates a sequence of pseudo-random numbers using a linear equation. While not suitable for cryptographic purposes, it is widely used in simulations and games.

    $$ X_{n+1} = (aX_n + c) \mod m $$

    Where:

    - \( X \) is the sequence of pseudo-random values
    - \( a \) is the multiplier
    - \( c \) is the increment
    - \( m \) is the modulus

2. Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) - LFSRs use shift registers and feedback taps to generate pseudo-random sequences. They are efficient and can produce long periods, making them suitable for applications like digital communication and error correction.

    **LFSR Visual Example**

    Here's how a 4-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register works:

    ```txt
    Initial State: [1][0][1][1]
                    â           â
                    bit 3       bit 0

    Feedback Taps: XOR between bit 3 and bit 2
    ```

    **Step-by-step operation:**

    **How LFSR chooses XOR operands:**

    The XOR operands are determined by the **feedback taps** - specific bit positions chosen based on primitive polynomials that ensure maximum period length.

    **In our 4-bit example:**
    - **Feedback taps**: positions 3 and 2 (counting from 0)
    - **XOR operation**: Always between the bits at these fixed positions
    - **Polynomial**: xâ´ + xÂ³ + 1 (which translates to taps at positions 3 and 2)

    ```txt
    Step 0: [1][0][1][1] â Output: 1
            XOR(bit3=1, bit2=1) = 0

    Step 1: [0][1][0][1] â Output: 1  
            XOR(bit3=0, bit2=0) = 0

    Step 2: [0][0][1][0] â Output: 0
            XOR(bit3=0, bit2=1) = 1

    Step 3: [1][0][0][1] â Output: 1
            XOR(bit3=1, bit2=0) = 1

    Step 4: [1][1][0][0] â Output: 0
            XOR(bit3=1, bit2=0) = 1

    Step 5: [1][1][1][0] â Output: 0
            XOR(bit3=1, bit2=1) = 0
    ```

                        âââââââââ
    ```

    **Generated Sequence:** 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ...

    This 4-bit LFSR with feedback taps at positions 3 and 2 generates a pseudo-random sequence with a period of 15 (2â´ - 1).

3. Blum Blum Shub (BBS) - A cryptographically secure PRNG based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. It generates random bits using modular arithmetic and is considered secure for cryptographic applications.

    **Algorithm Steps:**
    1. Choose two large prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that 
    $p \equiv q \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$
    2. Compute \( n = p * q \).
    3. Select a random seed \( x_0 \) such that \( x_0 \) is coprime to \( n \).
    4. Generate the sequence using the recurrence relation:
        $$ x_{i+1} = x_i^2 \mod n $$
    5. The output bit is the least significant bit of \( x_i \).

    **Example:**
    - Let \( p = 7 \), \( q = 11 \) (both primes congruent to 3 mod 4)
    - Compute \( n = 7 \times 11 = 77 \)
    - Choose seed \( x_0 = 3 \) (coprime to 77)

    **Sequence Generation:**

    ```txt
    i |   x_i   | x_i^2 mod 77 | Output Bit (LSB)
    ----------------------------------------------
    0 |   3     |     9        |        1
    1 |   9     |     4        |        0
    2 |   4     |     16       |        0
    3 |   16    |     25       |        1
    4 |   25    |     23       |        1
    ...
    ```
